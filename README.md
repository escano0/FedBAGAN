# FedBAGAN
A production of BAGAN model implimented on Federated Learning structure with pytorch.
The code can be run on colab by following instruction:
1. running_BAGAN (Run code chunks from top to bottom, and skip the 'GAN training' chunk 
ps:aotoencoder and Fed_BAGAN training would take lot of time)
2. inference 
3. Calculate_FID
4. visualize_loss

Noticed that the saving dir and training dir in each code should be change due to actural saving dir

Modify BAGAN here
